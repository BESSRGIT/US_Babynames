# US_Babynames
#### CONTENT: Babynames based on US dataset from 1880 - 2017
#### MOTIVATION: 
This was a project during bootcamp  at SPICED Academy and was intended to get familiar with pandas. Even though this is not a brandnew project, I have still published it here, as I found one "odd" correlation, when looking for my name "Bilgehan" :)
